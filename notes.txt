# Plan
  - Update game client-side
    - server calculates question progress and sends player proper state when player joins
    - client side will ping server for state, updates accordingly
    -  player will send answer and current time when buzzing, server will evaluate and change player/room state
	  - if wrong: server locks out  player
	  - if right: server awards points and becomes idle
	-  player can request next question
	  - if cond met (state is idle or overtime): go to next question
